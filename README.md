This is my first repository at github in this I have create a inventory management system for a stationary shop.
In this ,if we sell any product it can generate a  unique bill for every sell.
It also provides all information about our shop which product is available in which quantity . 
At the time of filling of our shop we can update our shop product list.
I have used  .json to create list of products in our shop.
And all logics are written in python .
